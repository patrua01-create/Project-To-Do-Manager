Personal To-Do Manager 

Task: Create a full-stack web app using Claude Code. 

Goal: Deliver a working MVP that demonstrates end-to-end product implementation (frontend + backend + persistence + tests) with Claude Code assistance. Developer chooses stack, database, UI library, and hosting approach (local run is required) 

Business scenario: A user manages personal work across multiple projects and wants a simple system to plan tasks, set priorities and deadlines, and quickly see what requires attention today and this week. 

 

1) Core rules 

The system supports multiple users 

Each user sees only their own data 

There is no sharing of any kind (no invites, no public links, no shared lists) 

 

2) Functional requirements 

2.1 Authentication and accounts (SSO only) 

User authentication must be implemented via SSO 

The app must support both providers 

Google OAuth (OpenID Connect) 

GitHub OAuth 

The app must support logout 

A logged-in user must stay authenticated across page refresh (session or token based) 

The backend must persist a user profile minimally containing 

provider (google or github) 

provider_user_id 

email (if provided by the provider) 

display_name 

avatar_url (optional) 

 

2.2 Lists / Projects 

A user can create a list/project 

A user can rename a list/project 

A user can delete a list/project 

Deleting a list/project must be handled by one approach and documented in README 

Cascade delete all tasks in the list 

Block deletion until tasks are removed 

2.3 Tasks 

Each task belongs to exactly one list/project and includes the following fields 

Title 

Description/notes 

Status: To Do, In Progress, Done 

Due date 

Priority: Low, Medium, High 

Task operations 

Create a task in a selected list 

Edit any task fields 

Delete a task 

Change status quickly from the task list view 

2.4 Search and filters 

Search tasks by title and description 

Filter tasks by status 

Filter tasks by priority 

Filter tasks by due date category: overdue, today, next 7 days, all 

 

      2.5 Real-time communication (WebSocket notifications) 

      The app must include two-way communication using WebSocket 

      Server → client notifications 

When the user is connected, the backend must push task notifications over WebSocket 

Notification types must include at least 

Overdue tasks (status is not Done and due date is before today) 

Due soon tasks (status is not Done and due date is within the next 3 days, inclusive) 

The client must display notifications in the UI (toast, banner, or a notification panel) 

Client → server messages (required to make it truly two-way) 

The client must send at least one meaningful WebSocket message, for example 

subscribe message after connection with user preferences like interval or enabled types 

ack message to mark a notification as read 

The chosen message(s) must be documented in README together with the message format 

Scheduling rule 

On WebSocket connect, server sends an initial notification batch 

While connected, server repeats the check periodically (developer chooses interval and documents it) 

 

3) UI requirements  (modern, styled, responsive, interactive) 

Authentication screen includes “Continue with Google” and “Continue with GitHub” 

Main layout with a left area for lists/projects and a main area for tasks 

Task list view for the selected list 

Task create and edit UI (modal, drawer, or separate page is acceptable) 

Search input and filter controls accessible from the task list view 

Notifications UI visible while connected to WebSocket 

Responsive behavior for narrow screens (sidebar collapses or becomes a menu) 

To make “modern and styled” checkable, the UI must include 

Consistent spacing and typography across screens 

Visible hover and focus states for interactive elements 

Clear empty states for lists with no tasks and for search with no results 

Loading state for at least one main screen or data block 

Client-side form validation feedback for task create/edit 

 

4) Backend requirements 

Provide a REST API (or equivalent HTTP API) that supports the UI flows 

Enforce authorization on every list/task operation 

Enforce authorization on WebSocket connections and notifications 

Validate inputs and return clear errors for invalid requests 

Implement SSO OAuth flows securely and document environment variables required for Google and GitHub providers 

 

5) Data requirements 

Persist data in a database chosen by the developer 

Provide a simple way to start with sample data (seed script or “create sample data” endpoint or documented manual steps) 

 

6) Quality requirements 

Automated tests must cover at least these cases 

SSO login success path in test mode using a mock or stub provider response 

A user can create a list and a task 

A user cannot access another user’s list/tasks (authorization test) 

WebSocket notifications are sent for overdue or due soon tasks (can be tested via an in-memory WS client or mocked clock) 

 

7) Deliverables 

Source code in a GitLab repository 

README with local run instructions for backend and frontend 

README section describing 

how to configure Google OAuth credentials 

how to configure GitHub OAuth credentials 

WebSocket message formats and notification rules 

Short API description (OpenAPI, Postman collection, or README section) 

Test command documented and runnable 

Optional deliverable 

Containerization (Dockerfile and or docker-compose) 

If containerization is not possible on the developer machine, it can be skipped and noted in README 

 
8)  Acceptance checklist 

A new user can log in with Google and GitHub 

A user can create lists, create tasks, and use search/filters 

Data is private per user and cannot be accessed cross-account 

While connected, the app receives real-time notifications for overdue and due soon tasks 

The WebSocket flow includes at least one client→server message that changes server behavior (subscribe or ack) 

Tests pass locally 

README is sufficient for another developer to run the app without guessing
